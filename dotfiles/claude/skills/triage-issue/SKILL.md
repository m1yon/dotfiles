# Triage Issue

Investigate a reported problem, find its root cause, and create a Linear issue with a TDD fix plan. If on a feature branch tied to a Linear PRD, creates the issue as a sub-issue. This is a mostly hands-off workflow - minimize questions to the user.

## Process

### 1. Capture the problem

Get a brief description of the issue from the user. If they haven't provided one, ask ONE question: "What's the problem you're seeing?"

Do NOT ask follow-up questions yet. Start investigating immediately.

### 1b. Check for parent PRD

Get the current branch name:
```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If the branch name contains a Linear issue identifier (e.g., `MECA-123`), use `get_issue` MCP tool with `branchName` set to the branch name to fetch the parent PRD. Store this for step 5.

If no issue is found or the branch is `main`/`master`, proceed without a parent — the issue will be created as a top-level issue.

### 2. Explore and diagnose

Use the Agent tool with subagent_type=Explore to deeply investigate the codebase. Your goal is to find:

- **Where** the bug manifests (entry points, UI, API responses)
- **What** code path is involved (trace the flow)
- **Why** it fails (the root cause, not just the symptom)
- **What** related code exists (similar patterns, tests, adjacent modules)

Look at:
- Related source files and their dependencies
- Existing tests (what's tested, what's missing)
- Recent changes to affected files (`git log` on relevant files)
- Error handling in the code path
- Similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase that work correctly

### 3. Identify the fix approach

Based on your investigation, determine:

- The minimal change needed to fix the root cause
- Which modules/interfaces are affected
- What behaviors need to be verified via tests
- Whether this is a regression, missing feature, or design flaw

### 4. Design TDD fix plan

Create a concrete, ordered list of RED-GREEN cycles. Each cycle is one vertical slice:

- **RED**: Describe a specific test that captures the broken/missing behavior
- **GREEN**: Describe the minimal code change to make that test pass

Rules:
- Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details
- One test at a time, vertical slices (NOT all tests first, then all code)
- Each test should survive internal refactors
- Include a final refactor step if needed
- **Durability**: Only suggest fixes that would survive radical codebase changes. Describe behaviors and contracts, not internal structure. Tests assert on observable outcomes (API responses, UI state, user-visible effects), not internal state. A good suggestion reads like a spec; a bad one reads like a diff.

### 5. Create the Linear issue

Create a Linear issue using the `save_issue` MCP tool on the **MECA Therapies** team with the template below. Set the issue type to **Bug**. Assign the issue to me. Apply the **AI** label. Set status to **Todo**.

- **If a parent PRD was found in step 1b:** set the parent issue to the PRD. This makes the triage issue a sub-issue of the PRD.
- **If no parent PRD:** create as a top-level issue.

Do NOT ask the user to review before creating - just create it and share the URL.

<issue-template>

## Problem

A clear description of the bug or issue, including:
- What happens (actual behavior)
- What should happen (expected behavior)
- How to reproduce (if applicable)

## Root Cause Analysis

Describe what you found during investigation:
- The code path involved
- Why the current code fails
- Any contributing factors

Do NOT include specific file paths, line numbers, or implementation details that couple to current code layout. Describe modules, behaviors, and contracts instead. The issue should remain useful even after major refactors.

## TDD Fix Plan

A numbered list of RED-GREEN cycles:

1. **RED**: Write a test that [describes expected behavior]
   **GREEN**: [Minimal change to make it pass]

2. **RED**: Write a test that [describes next behavior]
   **GREEN**: [Minimal change to make it pass]

...

**REFACTOR**: [Any cleanup needed after all tests pass]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] Existing tests still pass

## Context (only if sub-issue)

Filed during triage on branch for {PRD identifier}: {PRD title}.

</issue-template>

After creating the issue, print:

```
Issue created: {IDENTIFIER}: {title}
{linear_url}
Root cause: {one-line summary}
```

If a parent PRD was linked, also print:
```
Parent PRD: {PRD identifier}: {PRD title}
```
